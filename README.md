# JavaScript Practice Questions

This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript practice problems. Each problem has its own solution along with explanations.


### Question 1: String Case Swapper
Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example, if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox', the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

### Question 2: Array Generator
Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7]. Similarly, if the numbers are -4 and 7, the output should be [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

### Question 3: Prime Number Filter
You are tasked with writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. The function should efficiently identify prime numbers and return them in the same order they appear in the input array. For example, if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].
